- schematic
    - is is possible to make two layers and move them in relation to each other?
    - separate layer and address space for schematic
    - schematic IC
    - add schematic IC
    - select IC
    - delete IC
    - move IC
    - schematic wire (intiallay copy)
    - add schematic wire
    - select wire
    - delete wire
    - move wire end
    - add bends in schematic wire
- add IC
    - rectangle @done
    - selection
    - move
- select wire
- delete wire
add breadboard
move breadboard (one in relation to another)

scenario:
- make schematics in one of the open editors OR draw it here
- export / import into editor
- pick parts and put them on the breadboard
- auto create wires between components (maybe only selected ones)
- moving part will auto-move wires
- wires can be moved
- mark connections that does not exist / missing on schematic
