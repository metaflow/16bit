- make selection an action on toolbar @done
- remove normal righ / middle click menu @done
- add orthogonal wire action @done
- right click deselects
- mark wire points attached to contacts
- make contact capture clicks in a bigger area than itself
- when adding wire - click on contact should complete the wire
- schematic serealization
- option to align to grid
- align to IC contacts
- option to align to contacts
- add non orthogonal action (make it parameter of a stage)
- fix start / end wire point
- schematic
    - toolbar to add components @done
    - is it possible to make two layers and move them in relation to each other?
    - separate layer and address space for schematic
    - add IC should be in different color
    - schematic IC @done
    - add schematic IC @done
    - select IC @done
    - delete IC
    - move IC
    - schematic wire (intiallay copy)
    - make wire with orthogonal bends
    - add schematic wire
    - select wire
    - delete wire
    - move wire end
    - add bends in schematic wire
- add IC
    - rectangle @done
    - selection
    - move
- select wire
- delete wire
add breadboard
move breadboard (one in relation to another)

scenario:
- draw a scrematic, with LED, ground and other
- click on schematic parts and move them to the breadboard
- hover on schematic / breadboard to highlight corresponding part in a different view
- auto create wires between components (maybe only selected ones)
- moving part auto-move wires
- mark connections that does not exist / missing on schematic
- assign height layers to wires, mark potential itersections between wires, show only wires of one layer
